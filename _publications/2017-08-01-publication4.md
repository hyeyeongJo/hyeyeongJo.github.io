excerpt: 'A major limitation in anti-tuberculosis drug screening is the lack of reliable and scalable models for homogeneous human primary macrophage cells of non-cancer origin. Here we report a modified protocol for generating homogeneous populations of macrophage-like cells from human embryonic stem cells. The induced macrophages, referred to as iMACs, presented similar transcriptomic profiles and characteristic immunological features of classical macrophages and were permissive to viral and bacterial infection, in particular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). More importantly, iMAC production was amenable to scale up. To evaluate iMAC efficiency in high-throughput anti-tuberculosis drug screening, we performed a phenotypic screening against intracellular Mtb, involving a library of 3,716 compounds that included FDA-approved drugs and other bioactive compounds. Our primary screen identified 120 hits, which were validated in a secondary screen by dose-intracellular and -extracellular Mtb assays. Our confirmatory studies identified a novel anti-Mtb compound, 10-DEBC, also showing activity against drug-resistant strains.'

Objectives: To find the catalytic activities of CYP191A1 from Mycobacterium smegmatis, in which functions of most P450s are unknown, by using a set of reductase systems, peroxides, and various substrates including fatty acids and human drugs.

Results: CYP191A1 was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Its catalytic activities were examined with fatty acids, chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates, and several human P450 substrates, in the presence of six different types of electron transfer systems, such as rat NADPH-P450 reductase, Candida NADPH-P450 reductase, ferredoxin/ferredoxin reductase, putidaredoxin/putidaredoxin reductase, and peroxides (H2O2 and t-butyl hydroperoxide). The reactions catalyzed by CYP191A1 included the hydroxylation and O-dealkylation of several substrates.

Conclusions: CYP191A1 preferentially catalyzes the peroxide-dependent oxidation of various substrates over the reductase-dependent reaction. Its peroxygenase activity may be used an effective biocatalytic tool to synthesize the metabolites of drugs.
