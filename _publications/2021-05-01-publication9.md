excerpt: 'The Korea National Stem Cell Bank has been banking pluripotent stem cell (PSC) lines since 2012. Quality-controlled and ethically sourced cell lines were developed for distribution. Currently (as of 2020), among the 69 deposited lines, 4 research-grade human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines and 19 induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines have been distributed. Good manufacturing practices (GMP)-compliant homozygous iPSC lines for regenerative medicine with homozygous HLA haplotypes that cover 51% of the Korean population have been deposited as well. To ensure the quality of the cell lines, we performed eighteen different quality tests on the identity, sterility, consistency, stability and safety of the cell lines. Regarding genetic stability, we are collecting SNPchip, WES, Methyl-seq, and RNA-seq data, which are open to the public.s.'
