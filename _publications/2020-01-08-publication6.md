excerpt: 'Assessment of differentiation potential is a basic requirement to obtain qualified human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Here, we report a simple differentiation method using fetal bovine serum (FBS) to estimate differentiation potential and propensity of hPSCs. PluriTest using RNA-sequencing showed that cells differentiated after treatment with 5% FBS. Expression patterns of three germ layer markers revealed that cells cultured in Knockout Serum Replacement-containing medium (KSR) with mouse feeder cells had higher differentiation potential than cells cultured in a chemically defined medium (E8) with recombinant matrix proteins, especially into the mesoderm and endoderm lineages. Analysis of differentially expressed genes between KSR and E8 identified DUSP6 as a marker for where cells had been cultured. Expression of DUSP6 correlated with FGF-ERK signaling activity. Fine-tuning of FGF-ERK signaling activity to a range that can shut down DUSP6 transcription but sustain NANOG transcription partially increased the differentiation potential. Our data suggest that differentiation with 5% FBS is good to estimate differentiation potential and propensity at the early stage, and that DUSP6 is an excellent marker to monitor ERK signaling activity.'

A major limitation in anti-tuberculosis drug screening is the lack of reliable and scalable models for homogeneous human primary macrophage cells of non-cancer origin. Here we report a modified protocol for generating homogeneous populations of macrophage-like cells from human embryonic stem cells. The induced macrophages, referred to as iMACs, presented similar transcriptomic profiles and characteristic immunological features of classical macrophages and were permissive to viral and bacterial infection, in particular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). More importantly, iMAC production was amenable to scale up. To evaluate iMAC efficiency in high-throughput anti-tuberculosis drug screening, we performed a phenotypic screening against intracellular Mtb, involving a library of 3,716 compounds that included FDA-approved drugs and other bioactive compounds. Our primary screen identified 120 hits, which were validated in a secondary screen by dose-intracellular and -extracellular Mtb assays. Our confirmatory studies identified a novel anti-Mtb compound, 10-DEBC, also showing activity against drug-resistant strains.
