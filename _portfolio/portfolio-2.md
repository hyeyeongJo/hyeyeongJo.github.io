title: "Disease Risk Prediction using text-based heterogeneous dataset"
excerpt: Severity prediction against COVID-19 is crucial to perform early screening, detection and stratification of patients with COVID- 19. In this study, I, as a principle investigator (PI), developed machine learning (ML) models that predict COVID-19 severity based on clinical and laboratory testing data from 300 COVID-19 patients and 120 healthy controls. The proposed ML model with the selected features showed accurate prediction of COVID-19 severity. It is expected that this results provide evidence for not only efficient data- driven decision support to clinicians in urgent COVID-19 diagnostic situations, but also early detection and stratification of COVID-19 severity. Further, this study would be expanded into integrative approaches based on heterogeneous dataset, including high-dimensional omics to figure out remarkable markers for COVID-19 severity. <br/><img src='/images/Research_Project2.png'>
